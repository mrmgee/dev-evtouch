One of the few animals to use tools, an otter will pick up a    sea urchin and a small rock from the seafloor. Once back at the surface, the otter rolls onto its back, places    the rock on its chest, and smashes the urchin against the rock until its shell is broken.<BR><BR>   Sea otters were nearly wiped out by fur trappers by the early 1900s. Still listed on the U.S. Endangered Species List, the sea otter is making a comeback, thanks   to international protections&#151;and to marine sanctuary designations for critical   otter habitats, such as Monterey Bay.  <!--  <BR><BR>  The smallest species of marine mammal, sea otters are closely related to weasels. Unlike every other    marine mammal, sea otters have no blubber, so they must maintain a high metabolism by eating some 15    pounds (7 kilograms) of food a day&#151;about 25 percent of their body weight.   -->   </B></FONT><BR>   </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
